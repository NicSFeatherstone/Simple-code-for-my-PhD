# Simple-code-for-my-PhD
Over the course of my studies I have used several sets of rather simple bits of code, in this repository I have put down the bits of code that I have found useful during my time as a PhD student.

The bits of code are: 

In Scilab:
asf : this generates the classical Anderson-Shultz-Flory distribution as used to determine the selectivity of the Fischer Tropsch reaction
WGS eq : generates X/T plots for the water gas shift reaction
RWGS eq : generates X/T plots for the water gas shift reaction
dPH2Odt : probably the mose useless bit of code to anyone who isn't me. This calculates the partial pressure of water within a slurry phase reactor during a period of co-feeding of water and then the subsequent removal of that water from the system.
